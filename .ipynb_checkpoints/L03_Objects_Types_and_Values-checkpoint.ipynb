    "### Programming techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "1- When we need to solve a problem, we look for a similar problem and use our solution for that with suitable modification. Don’t start from scratch unless you really have to. Using a previous version of a program as a base for modification often saves a lot of time, and we benefit from much of the effort that went into the original program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Learning to ask the right (often hard) questions is an essential part of learning to think as a programmer. Asking only the easy and obvious questions would make you feel good, but it wouldn’t help make you a programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- The fastest way to understand real-world code is through a good understanding of the fundamentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- Always initialize your variables!\n",
    "\n",
    "5- The first rule for the use of parentheses is simply “If in doubt, parenthesize,” but please do learn enough about expressions so that you are not in doubt about a*b+c/d . Overuse of parentheses, as in (a*b)+(c/d) , decreases readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "6- Constants make code more readeble. For example, if in code you use some constant named \"pi\", then it is easy to understand than using \"3.14\" instead of \"pi\" in you code. In addition, it will be easy to update the value of \"pi\" without changing the whole code where \"pi\" is used. So never use literal in you code directly. Use constants with descriptive names which have values you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "7- We must always test our programs with “bad” input, because someone will eventually — intentionally or accidentally — enter bad input. A program should behave sensibly even if its users don’t."

    "## Names\n",
    "In ```C++``` names must start with letter, and they can only contain letters, numbers and underscores.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Never use ```_``` (underscore) as first letter of a name in ```C++```, because that kind of names of reserved for system codes and they can cause problems.\n",

    "character, such as one and One ; that will not confuse a compiler, but it can easily\n",
    "confuse a programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- When you choose names for your variables, functions, types, etc., choose meaningful names; that is, choose names that will help people understand your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- Don’t use overly long names; they are hard to type, make lines so long that they don’t fit on a screen, and are hard to read quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- Never use names with all capital letters, they are reserved for macros.\n",
    "\n",
    "6- In ```C++``` standard library types are not started with capital letters, therefore we use identifier started with capital letters for user defined types such as ```Graph``` or ```Book```\n",
    "\n",
    "7- Avoid names that are easy to mistype, misread, or confuse. For example:\n",
