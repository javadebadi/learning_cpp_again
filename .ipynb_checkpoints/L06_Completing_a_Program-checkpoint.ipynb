    "The first thing to do once you have a program that “basically works” is to try to break it; that is, we try to feed it input in the hope of getting it to misbehave. We say “hope” because the challenge here is to find as many errors as possible, so that you can fix them before anybody else finds them. If you go into this exercise with the attitude that “my program works and I don’t make errors!” you won’t find many bugs and you’ll feel bad when you do find one. You’d be playing head games with yourself! The right attitude when testing is “I’ll break it! I’m smarter than any program — even my own!” So, we feed the calculator a mix of correct and incorrect expressions."
