    "sloppy terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "A definition specifies exactly what a name refers to. In particular, a definition\n",
    "of a variable sets aside memory for that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a declaration that isn’t also a definition simply tells how you can use\n",
    "a name; it is just an interface and doesn’t allocate memory or specify a function\n",
    "body. Consequently, you can declare something as often as you like as long as\n",
    "you do so consistently:\n",
