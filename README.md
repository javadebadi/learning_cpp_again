# Learning C++

In this repository, I share codes from C++ books.
I already know and have worked for about 3 year with C++. Now, I want to solidify my knowledge and advance my C++ skill.

I am gonna write codes in Jupyter-notebook.

The main textbook which I will use is:
  Programming Principles and Practice Using C++ [Second Edition] by <b>Bjarne Stroustrup</b>
